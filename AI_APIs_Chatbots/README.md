# Workshop - Calling serverless functions from Watson Conversation 

In this workshop you will see how to call serverless functions directly from the Conversation service. 
This will allow the conversation to be driven by the service rather than having to create a middleware app that handles redirections to other services based on the intents detected.

## Before you begin

To complete this workshop you will need:
- IBM Cloud account
- Watson Conversation service

NB: If you already have a Conversation that you want to work from you can skip the two following steps.

**Creating your IBM Cloud account**

1. [Sign up for an account here](https://ibm.biz/BdZFpJ)
2. Verify your account by clicking on the link in the email sent to you
3. Log in to your IBM Cloud account

**Provisioning the Conversation service**
1. Click on "Catalog" on the top-right corner
2. Search and select "Conversation" 
3. Click "Create"

All set!

You can now follow this tutorial: [Making programmatic calls from a dialog node](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/conversation/dialog-actions.html#call-action)

Use the instructions on how to make a **server** side call.
