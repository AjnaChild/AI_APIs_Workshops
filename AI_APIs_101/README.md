# Workshop 1 - Trying out an AI APIs using Node-RED

In this workshop you will get your first hands-on with a Natural Language Understanding API using Node-RED.

This workshop is made using IBM Cloud for simplicity, though if you feel more comfortable with an other platform, an other Natural Language service or if you want to run Node-RED on your machine, please do! 

## Before you begin

To complete this workshop you will need:
- A Node-Red instance
- A Natural Language Understanding service

**Creating a Node-RED app**

1. [Sign up for an account here](https://ibm.biz/BdZHfN)
2. Verify your account by clicking on the link in the email sent to you
3. Log in to your IBM Cloud account
4. Click on "Catalog" on the top-right corner
5. Search and select "Node-RED Starter" 
6. Give a unique name to your app and click "Create"

**Provisioning the NLU service**

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account
2. Click on "Catalog" on the top-right corner
3. Search and select "Natural Language Understanding" 
4. Create the service

**Linking your Node-RED app and the NLU service**

1. Go back to your dashboard by clicking on the IBM Cloud logo
2. Click on the name of the app you've previously created
3. Click on "Connections" on the left-hand side
4. Click on "Create Connection"
5. Click "Connect" next to your NLU service and then "Restage"
