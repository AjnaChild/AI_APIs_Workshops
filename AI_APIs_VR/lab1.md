# Workshop 1 - Trying out an Image Recognition service using Node-RED

In this workshop you will get your first hands-on with an Image Recogntion API using Node-RED.

This workshop is made using IBM Cloud for simplicity, though if you feel more comfortable with an other platform, an other Image Recognition service or if you want to run Node-RED on your machine, please do! 

## Before you begin

To complete this workshop you will need:
- A Node-Red instance
- A Visual Recognition service

**Creating a Node-RED app**

1. [Sign up for an account here](https://ibm.biz/BdZHfN)
2. Verify your account by clicking on the link in the email sent to you
3. Log in to your IBM Cloud account
4. Click on "Catalog" on the top-right corner
5. Search and select "Node-RED Starter" 
6. Give a unique name to your app and click "Create"

**Provisioning the VR service**

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account
2. Click on "Catalog" on the top-right corner
3. Search and select "Visual Recogition" 
4. Create the service

**Linking your Node-RED app and the VR service**

1. Go back to your dashboard by clicking on the IBM Cloud logo
2. Click on the name of the app you've previously created
3. Click on "Connections" on the left-hand side
4. Click on "Create Connection"
5. Click "Connect" next to your VR service and then "Restage"
